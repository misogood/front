      <h1>Goals</h1>
      <h2 style="font-size: 31px">READ ME! â¬‡</h2>
      <p>
        I don't exactly have a structured plan for my future. However, I do know
        some of the things I would like to accomplish. Some of these goals won't
        relate to school at all, some of them might relate to my desired
        occupation, and some of them are personal goals. It's just everything
        that I want for myself before a certain deadline. I might update it and
        change it every now and again. I just might check off what was
        accomplished(if I'm feeling like it).
