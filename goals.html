      <h1>Goals</h1>

      <p>
        I don't exactly have a structured plan for my future. However, I do know
        some of the things I would like to accomplish. Some of these goals won't
        relate to school at all, some of them might relate to my desired
        occupation, and some of them are personal goals. To follow my proces on my goals you can find socials on the about me tab!
