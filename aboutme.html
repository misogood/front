      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

      <h2>Here's some basic information...</h2>
      <p>
        As you should already know my name is Elayeh Thorpe. I'm just your
        standard highschool student who happens to love technology. I've always
        had an interest in technology. After exploring how to code through HYPE
        I'm starting to realize just how much I love it. There are so many
        possibilites with what I can create using code. For example, this
        webpage was created using code. Although, technology is a large part of
        my present and future, it's not all there is to me. I like other things
        like reading, animals, traveling, rock climbing, track, and others I
        can't seem to think of at the moment. It's probably because I don't have
        that many hobbies in the first place.ðŸ˜ª

      <p>
        As you can see there's not much I don't like. At least not much I can
        think of.

      <h2>What Does School Look Like For Me?</h2>
      <p>
        I can confidently say it looks pretty good for me. I currently have a
        4.0 GPA and I plan to keep it that way or get more credits. I'm in the
        Black Student Union(BSU) and Future Business Leaders of America(FBLA). I
        also am in Track and Field. I'm in the Steam program. I really like what
        I'm doing in school now. I'm meeting new people and experiencing new
        things. I'm learning about things relevant to my future career. I know
        that not everybody knows what they want when they grow up so I'm
        grateful that I already have an idea. Right now I'm taking an intro to
        software technology class right now which is putting me on the right
        path for my future. I also am taking mostly honors class right now. I'm
        very proud of what I'm achieving already.
      </p>
